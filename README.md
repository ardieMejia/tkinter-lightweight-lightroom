# A lightweight Lightroom alternative
1. Uses Tkinter.
3. Stacks effects then apply the stacked effect you chose to a batch of files.
4. Process goes like:
    - Choose an image you put inside **./input** folder
    - Tweak using up to 20 available effects
    - These effects are auto saved. Can be imported for future batch operations
    - Apply the stacked effects to a batch of files under **./batch**, or select a few from **./batch** and apply the stacked effects
5. Nothing special, except uses Python decorator to protect certain features, if important folders or files dont exist. I feel like that deservees mentioning.
